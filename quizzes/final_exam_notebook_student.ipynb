    "\n",
    "    You are presented with three closed doors. A car is behind one,   \n",
    "    and goats are behind the other two.  You pick one door (e.g., Door 1).  \n",
    "    The host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the other two     \n",
    "    doors (e.g., Door 3) to reveal a goat. The host then asks if you want   \n",
    "    to stick with your original choice (Door 1) or switch to the other  \n",
    "    remaining unopened door (Door 2).   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Create simulations where you test both strategies: staying with your  \n",
    "    original guess or switching to the other door.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    For instance: suppose you choose door 1 (and door 1 happens to have   \n",
    "    the car behind it).  Monty reveals either  door 2 or door 3  \n",
    "    (assume he selects one with equal probabilities).  In the no switching    \n",
    "    simulation you keep door 1 and win the car. In the switching strategy  \n",
    "    you pick the door he doesn't show (2 or 3) and get the goat.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    In another example you pick door 1, the car is behind door 2, Monty  \n",
    "    must reveal door 3 to show you a goat.\n",

    "    1) ask user for the number of simulations that are to be run for each  \n",
    "       strategy (1 number, use for both simulations)\n",
    "       User input must be validated to ensure it is a positive integer.\n",
    "    2) Print out the winning and losing probability in % terms e.g 50.00% \n",
